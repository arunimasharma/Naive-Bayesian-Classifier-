# Naive-Bayesian-Classifier-
Classification based on static data file in binary format. It calculates the good prediction percentage (without validation) and Laplace algorithm implementation. I did it for CS109 (Stanford) at Stanford University, California when I visited the campus for summer 2015 and scored 100/100 because of its low compilation time and accurate good prediction rates
